Setup Instructions

Clone the repository

Create folders and starter files using the scaffold command

Add your Supabase credentials to .env

Run the backend scripts to push data

Launch the frontend dashboard locally or deploy via Vercel/Netlify

Folder Structure

See "Project Folder Structure" section above for details on each directory and file.

Deployment Notes

Frontend can be deployed to Vercel or Netlify

Backend runs on Raspberry Pi and pushes data to Supabase

NASA-Style UI Inspiration

The dashboard mimics mission control panels with monospaced fonts, brushed metal textures, and analog-style indicators. UI elements include beveled buttons, barber pole animations, and segmented gauges to evoke a tactile, retro aesthetic.
